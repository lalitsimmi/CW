  <h1>My Favorite Animal                    </h1>
  <p>My favorite animal is a dog. I like dogs because they are fluffy. 
    I also like dogs because you can pet some of them and they will not bite .
     Sometimes they will bite. I also like dogs because they can be different sizes 
     and different breeds. They are sometimes nice and they can also be mean. 
     But they are normally nice. I only like nice dogs because they do not hurt you.
